### Custom Icons

This package includes custom icons for the `.packshiprc` configuration file in the `assets/icons/` directory. These icons are excluded from version control and npm packages by default, but are available locally for your use.

To use them in VS Code:

#### Option 1: Use with Popular Icon Themes

1. Install one of these popular icon themes:
   - [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
   - [VSCode Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons)

2. Add a custom file association in your VS Code settings:
   ```json
   "workbench.iconTheme": "material-icon-theme", // or your preferred theme
   "material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
     ".packshiprc": "assets/icons/packshiprc.svg"
   }
   ```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

See the README in the `assets/icons/` directory for detailed instructions on how to use these icons and how to include them in your version control if desired.

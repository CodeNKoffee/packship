# Packship Icons

This directory contains icons for the Packship tool and its configuration files.

> **Note:** These icons are excluded from version control (via `.gitignore`) and npm packages (via `.npmignore`). They are included in your local project for your convenience but won't be committed to your repository or published with your package.

## Icons

- `packshiprc.svg` - Icon for `.packshiprc` files
- `packshiprc-32.svg` - Larger version of the icon

## How to Use These Icons in VS Code

We've included a sample VS Code settings file (`vscode-settings-example.json`) that you can use as a reference.

### Option 1: Use with Material Icon Theme

1. Install the [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
2. Add this to your VS Code settings.json:

```json
"material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
  ".packshiprc": "path/to/your/project/assets/icons/packshiprc.svg"
}
```

### Option 2: Use with VSCode Icons

1. Install the [VSCode Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons)
2. Add this to your VS Code settings.json:

```json
"vsicons.associations.files": [
  { "icon": "path/to/your/project/assets/icons/packshiprc.svg", "extensions": [".packshiprc"], "format": "svg" }
]
```

## Quick Setup

For a quick setup, you can:

1. Open VS Code settings (JSON format)
2. Copy the contents of `vscode-settings-example.json` 
3. Replace `path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project
4. Paste into your settings.json file

## If You Want to Include These Icons

If you want to include these icons in your version control or npm package:

1. Remove `assets/icons/` from your `.gitignore` and `.npmignore` files
2. Commit the changes to your repository
